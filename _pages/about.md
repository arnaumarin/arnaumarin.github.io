# Hi there - I'm Arnau

**PhD student @ Harvard | AI ¬∑ AI Agents ¬∑ BCI**

## About Me

Trained in electrical engineering, signal processing, and bioinformatics, I'm currently researching computational neuroscience, agentic AI, and building brain-computer interfaces to help address neurological disorders.

- Creator of **SpikeAgent** and **BCI-Agent**. Feel free to ask me about it!
- Passionate about advancing neurotechnology & open science

## What I'm Up To

- üî¨ Pushing the boundaries of neuroscience & AI
- ü§ñ Building agentic AI systems for Science
- üßë‚Äçüî¨ Always exploring new interdisciplinary projects in the BCI space

## Research Interests

- **Agentic AI** - Building AI agents for scientific research and discovery
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces** - Developing flexible BCIs to address neurological disorders  
- **Computational Neuroscience** - Understanding neural mechanisms through computational approaches
- **AI for Science** - Applying AI to accelerate scientific research and discovery

## Collaborations

I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including:

- [Prof. Jia Liu](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) (Harvard University) - *Current advisor*
- [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) (Neuromorphic Computing Lab, Intel)
- [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) (ICREA and University of Barcelona)
- [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://srl.ece.utah.edu/) (University of Utah)

## Fun fact

I am dangerously good at making handmade pizza! üçï
