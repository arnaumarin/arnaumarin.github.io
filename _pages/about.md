Hi there, thanks for vising my internet space.

I'm a PhD student at Harvard researching computational neuroscience and building new gen neurotechnology using AI approaches. 

## Research

My work spans computational neuroscience approaches to understanding neural mechanisms, developing brain-computer interfaces, building autonomous agents for scientific research, and applying machine learning to accelerate discovery and technology.

I'm the creator of [SpikeAgent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/SpikeAgent) and [BCI-Agent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/BCI-Agent), two multimodal agents that automate and standardize neural data analysis pipelines. If you want to learn more about that, feel free to contact either me or anyone of the team through Github or email!

## Collaborations

I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including [Prof. Jia Liu](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University (my current advisor), [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) at the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel, [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](hhttps://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) at ICREA and University of Barcelona, and [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://ece.uic.edu/profiles/terrones-benjamin/) at University of Utah; among others. 

I'm always excited to collaborate at the intersection of neuroscience, engineering, and machine learning - feel free to reach out!

## Personal

When I'm not in the lab, I'm dangerously good at making handmade pizza.
