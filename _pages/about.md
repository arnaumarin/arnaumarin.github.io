Hi there, thanks for vising my internet space.

I'm a PhD student at Harvard developing AI agents for neuroscience research and computational approaches to understanding both natural and artificial intelligence systems.

## Research

My work spans computational neuroscience approaches to understanding neural mechanisms, developing brain-computer interfaces, building autonomous agents for scientific research, and applying machine learning to accelerate discovery and technology.

I focus on building AI agents that can autonomously conduct scientific research, analyze complex neural data, and make new discoveries in neuroscience. Through these intelligent systems, I'm working to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and unlock insights that would be difficult or time-consuming to achieve through traditional approaches.

I'm the creator of [SpikeAgent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/SpikeAgent), an autonomous agent designed specifically for neuroscience research that can independently analyze neural data, identify patterns, and generate hypotheses. I've also developed [BCI-Agent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/BCI-Agent), a multimodal agent that has led to new discoveries in brain-computer interface research by automating complex analysis pipelines and uncovering previously hidden neural signatures. These agents represent a new paradigm where AI systems become active research partners, capable of making genuine scientific contributions. If you want to learn more about that, feel free to contact either me or anyone of the team through Github or email!

## Collaborations

I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including [Prof. Jia Liu](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University (my current advisor), [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) at the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel, [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](hhttps://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) at ICREA and University of Barcelona, and [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://ece.uic.edu/profiles/terrones-benjamin/) at University of Utah; among others. 

I'm always excited to collaborate at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and engineering - feel free to reach out!

## Personal

When I'm not in the lab, I'm dangerously good at making handmade pizza.
