Hi there, thanks for vising my internet space.

I'm a PhD student at Harvard developing AI agents for neuroscience research and computational approaches to understanding both natural and artificial intelligence systems.

## Research

I focus on building AI agents that can autonomously conduct scientific research, analyze complex neural data, and make new discoveries in neuroscience.

I created [SpikeAgent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/SpikeAgent), an AI agent based on large language models (LLMs) that does spike sorting and neural signal processing for you. 


I also developed [BCI-Agent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/BCI-Agent), a multi-agent system that helps you understand single-cell neural recordings by making it possible to infer cell types across different species, without needing transgenic animalsâ€”something that was not possible before.
If you want to learn more about that, feel free to contact either me or anyone of the team through Github or email!

## Collaborations
I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) at the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel and Zhaw, [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](hhttps://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) at ICREA and University of Barcelona, and [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://ece.uic.edu/profiles/terrones-benjamin/) at University of Utah; among others. 

I'm always excited to collaborate at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and engineering - feel free to reach out!

## Personal

When I'm not in the lab, I'm dangerously good at making handmade pizza.
