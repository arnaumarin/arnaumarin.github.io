Hello, thanks for visting! 

I'm Arnau, and I'm a second-year PhD student in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jia Liu](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/).

I'm trained in electrical engineering, signal processing, and bioinformatics. My current research efforts are in computational neuroscience, agentic AI and flexible brain-computer interfaces for neurological disorders. 

Previously I worked and colaborated with [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) (Neuromorphic Computing Lab of Intel), [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) (ICREA, and University of Barcelona), and [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://srl.ece.utah.edu/) (University of Utah), among others.
