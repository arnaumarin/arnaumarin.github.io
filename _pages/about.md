# Hi there - I'm Arnau

I'm a PhD student at Harvard researching computational neuroscience and building brain-computer interfaces to help address neurological disorders.

Trained in electrical engineering, signal processing, and bioinformatics, I'm passionate about creating intelligent systems that can accelerate scientific discovery and advance neurotechnology.

## Research

My work spans computational neuroscience approaches to understanding neural mechanisms, developing flexible and robust brain-computer interfaces, building autonomous agents for scientific research, and applying machine learning to accelerate discovery.

I'm the creator of [SpikeAgent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/SpikeAgent) and [BCI-Agent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/BCI-Agent), two multimodal agents that automate and standardize neural data analysis pipelines. If you want to learn more about that, feel free to contact either me or anyone of the team through Github or email!

## Collaborations

I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including Prof. Jia Liu at Harvard University (my current advisor), Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya at the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel, Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives at ICREA and University of Barcelona, and Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones at University of Utah.

I'm always excited to collaborate at the intersection of neuroscience, engineering, and machine learning - feel free to reach out!

## Personal

When I'm not in the lab, I'm dangerously good at making handmade pizza.
