Hello, thanks for visting! 

I'm Arnau, and I'm a second-year PhD student in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I'm trained in electrical engineering, signal processing, and bioinformatics. My current research efforts are in computational neuroscience, agentic AI and flexible brain-computer interfaces for neurological disorders.

I'm advised by [Prof. Jia Liu](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/), and I previously worked or colaborated with [Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives](https://www.icrea.cat/community/icreas/17606/maria-victoria-sanchez-vives/) at the University of Barcelona, [Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones](https://srl.ece.utah.edu/) in the University of Utah, and [Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya](https://sandamirskaya.eu/) at Neuromorphic Computing Lab of Intel Corporation.
