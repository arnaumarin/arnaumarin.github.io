# Hi there - I'm Arnau

I'm a PhD student at Harvard researching computational neuroscience, agentic AI, and brain-computer interfaces to help address neurological disorders.

Trained in electrical engineering, signal processing, and bioinformatics, I'm passionate about building AI agents that can accelerate scientific discovery and advance neurotechnology.

## Research

My work focuses on four main areas: **Agentic AI** for scientific research and discovery, **Brain-Computer Interfaces** that are flexible and robust, **Computational Neuroscience** approaches to understanding neural mechanisms, and **AI for Science** applications that accelerate research.

I'm the creator of [SpikeAgent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/SpikeAgent) and [BCI-Agent](https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/BCI-Agent), two multimodal AI agents that automate and standardize neural data analysis pipelines.

## Collaborations

I've had the privilege of working with exceptional researchers including Prof. Jia Liu at Harvard University (my current advisor), Prof. Yulia Sandamirskaya at the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel, Prof. Mavi Sanchez-Vives at ICREA and University of Barcelona, and Prof. Benjamin Sanchez-Terrones at University of Utah.

## Personal

When I'm not in the lab, I'm dangerously good at making handmade pizza. I'm always excited to collaborate at the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and engineering - feel free to reach out!
